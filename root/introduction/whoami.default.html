<p>I started my career as a software engineer at <a href="https://vwd.com">vwd:</a> where we work on near real time stock exchange feed data processing systems</p>
<p>I am an advocate of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html">GNU+Linux</a> operating system and the <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html">Unix philosophy</a></p>
<p>Besides my special interest for computer systems, i also enjoy riding my <a href="motorcycle/zx600f.html">motorcycle</a></p>
<p>And <a href="books/toplist.html">here</a> you can find a list of my favorite books i have read so far</p>
<p>btw, i use <a href="https://archlinux.org">archlinux</a></p>
<p style="font-size:75%;">Here you can find: a <a href="https://github.com/ngrande/archsetup">setup script</a>, my <a href="https://github.com/ngrande/dotfiles">dot files</a>, some <a href="https://github.com/ngrande/scripts/">random scripts</a> (with some useful <a href="https://github.com/ngrande/scripts/tree/master/i3blocks/">i3 extensions</a>) and last but not least my <a href="https://github.com/ngrande/vim/">vim setup</a>. Most of it comes with a setup.sh script for installation - try it out?</p>
