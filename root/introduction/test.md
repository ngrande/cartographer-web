# Introduction
Welcome to the site of Niclas Grande.

Here i shall assemble a collection of material for the purpose of sharing my knowledge and personal experience about a topic of my most interest: practical computer science.

This obviously also serves a purpose for myself, which is to help _me_ better understand computer science.

## Reason
The pleasure in it shall be all that is necessary to produce.<br/>
Continue to strive for this pleasure, continue to seek for more.<br/>
Times where there is no pleasure in it is a wasteful spent resource.<br/>
