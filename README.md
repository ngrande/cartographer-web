# Cartographer Website
this contains the web content of [thecartographer.net](https://thecartographer.net)

## Cartographer as a backend
This project really consists of two parts: one is the content which can be found right in here and the other is the server.

The complete code for the server, which is written entirely in Go can be found [here](https://github.com/ngrande/cartographer)

## File formats
The content consists mostly of markdown and HTML files as those are my preferred formats and well known by others.
Surely you will also find some .css or pictures laying around, i try to make the site not look too sterile.

## Structure
All content of the site is located in the root directory and has the following hierarchy.


    root/
      |
      +-- index.html
      |
      +-- blog/
            |
            +-- the_cartographer.md
